This is a Spring Boot application that's used with the "Building a CRM Application " series on the <a href="https://careydevelopment.us" target="_blank">Carey Development website</a>.

It's a microservice that handles requests related to sending and receiving emails.

Each branch within this repo is related to a distinct guide. The master branch holds the latest version of the application.

If you want to follow along with the series, just visit the URL that points to the <a href="https://careydevelopment.us/tag/careydevelopmentcrm" target="_blank">careydevelopmentcrm tag</a>. 

Remember, all guides are in reverse chronological order so if you want to start from the beginning, you'll need to go to the last page.
